To make use of the distutils extenstions, you have to import the corresponding methods at the beginning of your setup.py:

from DistUtilsExtra.distutils import build_extra, build_l10n

Furthermore you have to map the methods to the extended ones:

cmdclass = { "build" : build_extra,
             "build_l10n" :  build_l10n }

Finally you have to enable the use of the extension in your setup.cfg:

[build]
l10n=True

See the setup.cfg.example for a more complex layout.

Currently there are the following extensions available:

build_extra: initiates the extensions
build_l10n: provides gettext integration
build_icons: installs icons
build_help: installs a docbook based documentation

I hope that this code could help you to make your live easier,
